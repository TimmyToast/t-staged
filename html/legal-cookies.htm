<h1>Cookies</h1>

<h2>WHAT IS A COOKIE?</h2> 
<p>A cookie is a small data file stored by your web browser on your computer or your handheld device. Some cookies are essential for the website to work for example to remember what you have added to your basket while you browse the site. They are useful because they help us to provide you with relevant information, such as remembering what you have in your wish list or basket when you return to our site. They also allow us to recognise your computer (but not specifically who is using it) when you access our website and to improve the usability and performance of our website.</p>

<h2>WHAT IS A WEB BEACON?</h2> 
<p>Web beacons are usually tiny transparent images (gifs) that help us track the activity on certain web pages. They can also send the website owner (for example, us or our technology partners) information in cookies such as whether an email with a web beacon in it has been opened. We use web beacons together with cookies to help us understand how you interact with our website and to better manage our website and email content. They do not carry any personally identifiable information and are only used to track the effectiveness of a particular campaign.</p>

<h1>TYPES OF COOKIES</h1>
<h2>SESSION COOKIES</h2> 
<p>Session cookies are deleted after each 'session'. For example, when you are browsing a website, it will remember you for the duration of your visit, but the cookie will be removed from your computer as soon as you close down your internet browser. Without a session cookie, every time you open a new web page the web server where that page is stored will treat you like a completely new visitor and items placed in your shopping basket will disappear by the time you reach the checkout. These are used to show your recently viewed items, for us to understand how the site is used or where there may be issues.</p>

<h2>PERSISTENT COOKIES</h2> 

<p>Persistent cookies remember you for a set period of time unless you delete your cookies within this period. On your first visit to our site it will be presented to you in a default manner. Over time, the version of the site you see may change, as persistent cookies remember items you have viewed, preference changes you have made, or whether you logged into or out of your account while browsing. Here is a list of the different types of cookies we use and why we use them:</p>

When you log into a website with your Facebook account, the site can access information you've added on Facebook. The site does this to offer you a social and personalized experience.</p>
<p>The Facebook Platform Policies restrict how these sites can use your information. For example: If you've blocked someone on Facebook, they won't be able to see you on a site you've logged into.</p>
<p>When people log into a site, they won&rsquo;t be able to see information you've added through Facebook that they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to see by browsing on Facebook.</p>
