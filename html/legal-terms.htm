<h2>Acceptance</h2>

<p>You agree that your order is an offer to purchase the Products from TOAST (Mail Order) Limited and any associated delivery services from either TOAST (Mail Order) Limited or Contracts Limited as applicable as listed in your order. All orders are subject to acceptance by us. We may choose not to accept your order for any reason without liability to you.</p>

<p>After submitting an order, we will send you an order acknowledgement email with your order number and details of the Products you have ordered from us and details of any delivery services you have ordered from us.

</p>
<p>Please note that this email is an acknowledgement that we have received your order and is not an acceptance of your order. Acceptance of your order and the formation of:</p>

<p>(a) a contract of sale for the Products between TOAST (Mail Order) Limited and you; and</p>

<p>(b) as applicable a contract for any delivery services between you and either Contracts Limited in respect of residents in the EU but excluding UK and the Isle of Man; or TOAST (Mail Order) Limited in respect of delivery to residents in the UK and the Isle of Man or residents outside of the EU will not take place unless and until the earlier of (i) the date on which TOAST receives payment in full or (ii) when TOAST dispatches the Products to you or the Products are collected from TOAST by Contracts Limited on your behalf pursuant to your delivery contract with Contracts Limited.</p>


<h2>Pricing and Payment</h2>

<p>We may vary the prices on our site at any time and without any notice. If your order is to be delivered within the European Union, both the product price and delivery services price includes applicable VAT or sales tax payable. If your order is to be delivered outside the European Union, it may attract additional import duties and local sales taxes which you will need to pay on receipt of the shipment.</p>

<p>Delivery charges are itemised on the order acknowledgement issued by TOAST. Where applicable, TOAST receives the delivery charge on behalf of Contracts Limited. </p>

<p>Our Site contains a large number of Products and it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the Products listed on our site may be incorrectly priced. We will normally verify prices as part of our dispatch procedures so that, where a Product's correct price is less than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount when dispatching the Product to you. If a Product's correct price is higher than the price stated on our Site, we will normally, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before dispatching the Product, or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.</p>

<p>When you make a purchase for Products and delivery services as applicable from TOAST (Mail Order) Limited and/or Contracts Limited please make sure you do this in the currency of your bank or credit card. Please note that it is common practice for banks and credit card providers to have different selling and buying exchange rates for currency. We do not accept responsibility for charges or differing rates of currency exchange levied by a customer's bank or credit card provider. Prices for Delivery Services provided by Contracts Limited are stated in the currency specified in your country in our <a href="/content/help/help.htm#deliver-uk" title="Delivery Options">Delivery section.</a> </p>

<p>Any Products purchased prior to any markdowns or discount offered will not be refunded the difference. You may return the higher priced item in its original condition, to us for either a refund or an exchange. However, if returned for an exchange, this is subject to availability.</p>

<p>Outlet/Sale section – All ‘was’ pricing is the original RRP. ‘Now’ pricing reflects the latest markdown price.</p>

<h2>Payment</h2>

<p>More information about the payment methods that we accept are set out on the Site – <a href="/content/help/help.htm#faqs" title="TOAST FAQs">"How to Pay"</a>. You confirm that the credit/debit card or payment method that is being used is yours and that all details you provide to us in respect thereof including, without limitation, name and address details are complete, correct and accurate . You further confirm that the credit/debit card or payment method is valid and the inputted payment details correct. All credit/debit cardholders and any payment account holders are subject to validation checks and authorisation by the card issuer or payment method provider. If the issuer of your card refuses to authorise payment, we will not accept your order and we will not be liable for any delay or non-delivery and we are not obliged to inform you of the reason for the refusal. </p>

<p>We are not responsible for any charges or other amounts applied by your card issuer or bank or payment method provider as a result of our processing of your credit/debit card payment or other method of payment in accordance with your order. If your credit/debit card or payment method is not denominated in the currency of your purchase indicated on the Site, the final price may be charged in the currency of your card or account. Such final price is calculated and charged by your card issuer or bank or payment method provider and therefore we shall not be responsible for any cost, expense, charge or other liability incurred or suffered by you as a result of your card issuer or payment method provider charging you in a currency other than the currency set out on the Site.</p>

<p>In respect of delivery services for EU customers excluding the UK and the Isle of Man, Contracts Limited provide delivery to you. </p>

<p>When ordering, you will be offered our delivery service once you reach the delivery address details page. Orders will be sent to the delivery address that you have given on your order form. We cannot be held responsible if that delivery address is incorrect or incomplete. Please note that we do not deliver to PO boxes. Please note that there are restrictions on the locations to which we deliver Products purchased from the Site. Details of the locations to which we deliver are available from us on request. Please see the <a href="/content/help/help.htm#deliver-uk" title="TOAST Delivery Options">UK Delivery</a> and  <a href="/content/help/help.htm#deliver-international" title="TOAST Delivery Options">International Delivery</a> Options. </p>
