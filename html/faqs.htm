<h2>CAN I RETURN AN ITEM BOUGHT IN THE SALE?</h2>
<p>For items purchased in the sale, please refer to our <a href="/content/help/help.htm#deliver-returns" title="Returns policy">returns information</a>.</p>

<h2>WHY IS AN ITEM SHOWING IN YOUR CATALOGUE WHEN YOU HAVE ALREADY SOLD OUT?</h2>

<p>In a perfect world we would be able to perfectly and flawlessly predict exactly which items our customers are going to want and to 100% ensure that all our products are delivered on time and to our required high quality. Unfortunately, the world is not perfect and our predictions can be wrong and our suppliers can, sometimes, let us down. But we keep on trying to do better and better and we do make sure that our online stock levels are as up-to-date as they can be.</p>

<h2>WHAT IS A BACK ORDER?</h2>

<p>If an item is not yet in stock, but we are anticipating further supplies, we can put you onto back order. This means that when your chosen item comes into stock, we will send it on to you.</p>

<h2>CAN I GO ONTO TO BACK ORDER FOR A SOLD-OUT ITEM?</h2>

<p>Only if we are expecting further supplies. We no longer accept backorders for returned items, as this can sometimes lead to disappointment.</p>

<h2>HOW SECURE IS YOUR WEBSITE AND ARE MY PERSONAL DETAILS SAFE WITH YOU?</h2>
<p>Security is a major concern of customers who want to purchase online. Our relationship with you is based on trust. It is our policy to give you a totally private web browsing experience. For this reason, we do not require that you give us any information about yourself before you reach the checkout area of our site.</p>

<p>We have put in place a system that is much safer than giving your credit card details over the telephone or paying for a meal in a restaurant. When you wish to buy the items you have selected, your browser makes a connection to the secure section of our website. This connection is different from a connection for normal Internet browsing. Your browser should show an icon to indicate that it has made a secure connection, such as a security padlock. Depending on your browser settings, you may also get a message asking you if you want to continue and make the secure connection. We are using the very latest encryption technology (2048 signature / 256 bit encryption) SSL.</p>

<p>The information that you provide during purchasing your goods is entirely associated with your purchase. Any personal information you send to our secure server while the padlock icon is showing will be encrypted. This means no-one can intercept your details and read them.</p>

<p>Our data collection and storage is governed by the rules of the UK Data Protection Act. We will not divulge your email address to any other company.</p>

<h2>WHY DO YOU NEED MY TELEPHONE NUMBER?</h2>
<p>We keep a secure database with all our customers' telephone numbers so that we can contact you quickly if there is a query on your order.</p>
<h2>WHY DO YOU NEED MY EMAIL ADDRESS?</h2>
<p>We keep customers email address so that we can communicate with you quickly and also update you with the status of your order. With your consent, we would also like to keep you updated about our latest news, special offers and promotions.</p>
<h2>DO YOU USE COOKIES?</h2>
<p>Yes, on our web site we use cookies only to store information about the products you are interested in. So when you add a product to your basket we remember this information with a cookie. <a href="/content/help/help.htm#legal-cookies">Please click here to read more details about cookies.</a></p>
